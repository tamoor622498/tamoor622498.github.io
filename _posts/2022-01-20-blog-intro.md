title:  "Blog Introduction"

This blog will chronicle my journey as a Computer Engineer just about to graduate and enter into the professional world. In reality however, I hope to use this as a journal. A place where I can keep the things I’ve learned to reference later.

I hope to cover everything I’m interested in. From FPGAs to Microcontrollers to the odd blog on the most random topics.

Be warned, I’m still learning and wouldn’t consider myself as an expert on any topics really. But maybe using this platform as the second step in [The Feynman Technique](https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching) will help me get there.

If I make an error (almost 100% certainty), feel free to message me through the contact info I have listed.
