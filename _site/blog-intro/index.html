  <h1>Blog Introduction</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>This blog will chronicle my journey as a Computer Engineer just about to graduate and enter into the professional world. In reality however, I hope to use this as a journal. A place where I can keep the things I’ve learned to reference later.</p>

<p>I hope to cover everything I’m interested in. From FPGAs to Microcontrollers to the odd blog on the most random topics.</p>

<p>Be warned, I’m still learning and wouldn’t consider myself as an expert on any topics really. But maybe using this platform as the second step in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching">The Feynman Technique</a> will help me get there.</p>

<p>If I make an error (almost 100% certainty), feel free to message me through the contact info I have listed.</p>
